# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview of the Project

- The purpose of the project is to find bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. This can be done by studying and doccumenting baterial species that are not well known or even unknow to science. Many labs have had breakthrough research in synthesizing meat from other species found on algae, fungi and microorganisms found on plant roots. 

- Its possible that the bacteria found in the human belly button can be a perfect match for making synthesized beef. To test this hypothesis samples from different individuals is collected and analyized for the various bacterias that were found. Hence, a dashboard has to be built to view this data.

- This Dashboard with display the data anonymously of the individuals by giving them an ID number and this ID is linked to all the bacteria species found in their belly buttons. 

## Results

### Sources

- The link to the Script is:

- Softwares: VS Code, Javascript, HTML and CSS

- The Dashboard looks like the image below:

![init_pgLoad]()


- It loads the very first id information. From the dropdown menu, one can select the ID and view the bacteria data. The page shows visulazations in three different charts. 

- The Bar chart provieds information about the top 10 species found in the navel. The Gauge chart displays the frequency of washing the navel per week. The Bubble chart displays all the bacterial species found in the navel.

- Below is an image that display information when the ID is changed
